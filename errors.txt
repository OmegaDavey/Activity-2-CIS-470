------TASK 3 & 4 --------
Line 72: "let taxableIncome = income + getDeductions" should be "let taxableIncome = income - getDeductions", as the deductions are subtracted from the income to get the taxable income.
Line 91: "let stateTaxableIncome = income + getDeductions" should be "let stateTaxableIncome = income - getDeductions" as the deductions are subtracted from the income to get the taxable income.
Line 77: "federalTax += (taxableIncome - taxBrackets[1].lowerBound)" should be "federalTax += (taxableIncome - taxBrackets[i].lowerBound)" as the tax brackets are iterated through.
Line 80: "federalTax += (taxBrackets[i].upperBound - taxBrackets[1].lowerBound)" should be "federalTax += (taxBrackets[i].upperBound - taxBrackets[i].lowerBound)" as the tax brackets are itereated through
Line 126: "deductions += mortgage + studentLoan - medicalExpenses" should be "deductions += mortgage + studentLoan + medicalExpenses" as your med should be added to your total deductions
Line 94: Added a statement to check if your state tax is lower than 0, and if so set it to 0 so on your output you dont have negative taxes. (According to the readme file specifications)

No breakpoints were used, I have never used them and do not know how to therefor I could not apply them effectivly.

-----TASK 5-------
A: I just manually tested each case and made assumptions on what the issue could be and made a list of possible sections I may find errors in, I have never used breakpoints or watch before so I have no idea how to use them in VSCode. Using the list of possible points of error I went back through the test cases and would change signs and check for possible mistakes, such as the static value in errors 1 & 2, and fixed them in that manner

B: The specifications for the program didnt really describe how it was supposed to work but it gave you all the tools in order to fix/implement the needed changes to make the program work and match the test cases. The only issue is that I do not know how taxes work so figuring out that some things needed to be subtacted and how the tax brackets worked was a little hard in the beginning.

C: I feel as if the description of the program could be a little better, such as that your deductions should be subtracted from your income when calculating taxes, and as to how the bracket calcualtions are to be done, such as " if X is true and Y is false then you take tax bracket i's lower bound and subtract it from the upper bound..." or something to this effect. Thid would make troubleshooting errors even easier if I understood how the calculations were supposed to be made.

NOTE: Test 3 Should have been a student loan calculation of 1000, not 10000, as 1000 gives you the correct values without changing anything, 10000 will always give you the wrong answer no matter what modifications you make to the lona calcualtions.
